 `svd_acceleration.py` contains the main script. The first half of the script creates an LSTM model using the methods I developed in my other repositories. In this section it references `load_preprocess.py`, `frequency-prediction.py`, and `sequentialize.py`. If you only care about the SVD part then there is no need to look at those files. In `svd_classes.py` I created all the functions and objects that are used in the SVD reduction. I created cell objects for both full and reduced cells. In doing so I used functions from `numpy.linalg` and `tensorflow.keras.backend`.
